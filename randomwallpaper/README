================
Random Wallpaper
================

I needed this as other solutions were a little too complicated for my
liking.

Picks a random wallpaper from my dropbox directory and changes gnome
wallpaper for that.

I run it on cron to change at intervals, alternatively it works well
run from a launcher.
