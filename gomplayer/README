===========
GO! Mplayer
===========

A helper script to make mplayer useable by my girlfriend.

Just now can configure the -vo and -vc options for her based on
file extension in json config file setup.

Best way to use: Add application launcher to gnome-panel and drag+drop video on.

Relies on defaults for full screen and such in ~/.mplayer/config
